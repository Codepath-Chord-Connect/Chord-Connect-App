## Overview
### Description
Chord Connect is a social app that connects musicians within your proximity, collaborate together and possibly form a band/musician coalition.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Photo/Social/Music
- **Mobile:** Android first experience, uses camera and user location, and parse database (back4app)
- **Story:** Allows musicians to connect with other musicians within their proximity; musicians can view each other's description, the type of instrument they play, the type of music software they use, their profile picture, and their location (proximity of the other user)
- **Market:** Anyone that enjoys making music and wants to connect/collaborate with other musicians
- **Habit:** Users can post their profile pic, description, the type of instrument they play, the type of music software they use, and their location (to see other users near their area) 
- **Scope:** Since its just the start, our app is going to be focused on a narrow location, like University Park, PA.
